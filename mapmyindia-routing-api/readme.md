## Introduction

### Route and Navigation

Routing and displaying driving directions on map, including instructions for navigation, distance to destination, traffic etc. are few of the most important parts of developing a map based application. This REST API calculates driving routes between specified locations including via points based on route calculation type(optimal or shortest).
Routing API is supported for [238 countries](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-rest-api/blob/master/docs/countryISO.md) via the region parameter.

## Security Type
- License key based authentication
- IP/domain based whitelisting

2.  **`geo-positions`**: geopositions is either
	- pair of comma separated longitude & latitude values OR
	- eLoc(s). 
	
	First geoposition will be consider as start point (**mandatory**); a last geoposition will be considered as end point (**mandatory**) and those in between are via points (*optional*). Example:  {longitude1},{latitude1};{longitude2},{latitude2};eLoc1;eLoc2; ...] (part of URL).

### Optional Parameters

1.  *`geometries`*(string): This parameter used to change the route geometry format/density (influences overview and per step). Default value is
	- `polyline` with 5 digit precision; 
	- `polyline6` for 6 digit precision;
	- `geojson` for geometries as geojson.

## Response Parameters

2.	`routes`: An array of route objects, each having potentially multiple via points.
	- `geometry`: returns the whole geometry of the route as per given parameter ‘geometries’ default is encoded ‘polyline’ with 5 digit accuracy for positional coordinates.
	- `legs`: The legs between the given waypoints, representing an array of routes between two waypoints.
		- `steps`: Return route steps for each route leg depending upon steps parameter.
			- `intersections`: A list of Intersection objects<SUP>1</SUP>  that are passed along the segment, the very first belonging to the StepManeuver<SUP>2</SUP>.

				- `in`: index into bearings/entry array. Used to calculate the bearing just before the turn. Namely, the clockwise angle from true north to the direction of travel immediately before the maneuver/passing the intersection. Bearings are given relative to the intersection. To get the bearing in the direction of driving, the bearing has to be rotated by a value of 180. The value is not supplied for depart maneuvers.

				- `type`: A string indicating the type of maneuver. New identifiers might be introduced without API change. Types unknown to the client should be handled like the ‘turn’ type, the existence of correct modifier values is guaranteed. To see the complete list of types, please see [article](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-rest-api/wiki/types) in wiki.
			- `distance`: The distance of travel to the subsequent step, in float meters
			- `duration`: The estimated travel time, in float number of seconds
			- `geometry`: The un-simplified geometry of the route segment, depends on the given geometries parameter.
			- `weight`: Parameter for internal use only.
			- `name`: The name of the way along which travel proceeds.

	- `distance`: The distance of travel, in float meters.
	- `duration`: The estimated travel time, in float number of seconds.
3.	`waypoints`: Array of Waypoint objects representing all waypoints in order
	- `hint`: Unique internal identifier of the segment (ephemeral, not constant over data updates) This can be used on subsequent request to significantly speed up the query and to connect multiple services. E.g. you can use the hint value obtained by the nearest query as hint values for route inputs.
	- `name`:  Name of the street the coordinate snapped to.
	- `location`: longitude, latitude pair describing the snapped location of the waypoint.
	- `distance`: distance to snapped location from actual location.
4. `Server`: Gives Information on active service's server.

### Notes
1. An intersection gives a full representation of any cross-way the path passes bay. For every step, the very first intersection (intersections[0]) corresponds to the location of the StepManeuver. Further intersections are listed for every cross-way until the next turn instruction.
2. An object type representing maneuver.
