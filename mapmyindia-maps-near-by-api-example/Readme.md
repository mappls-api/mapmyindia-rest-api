## Introduction
Nearby Places API, enables you to add discovery and search of nearby POIs by searching for a generic keyword used to describe a category of places or via the unique code assigned to that category.

## Live Demo

## Security Type
This APIs follow OAuth2 based security. **To know more on how to create your authorization tokens, please use our authorization token URL. More details available**  [here](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/authentication-api.php)

## Request Headers

The API leverages OAuth 2.0 based security. Hence, the developer would need to send a request for access token using their client_id and client_secret to the OAuth API. Once validated from the OAuth API, the access_token and the token_type need to be sent as Authorization header with the value: “{token_type} {access_token}”.

-  `Authorization:  “token_type access_token”`.

## Input Method
GET

## Input URL

[https://atlas.mapmyindia.com/api/places/nearby/json?](https://atlas.mapmyindia.com/api/places/nearby/json?)

## Response Type

JSON


## Request Parameters
The “**bold**” one’s are mandatory, and the “*italic*” one’s are optional.

1. Mandatory Parameters:
	- ***`keywords`***  (string) e.g. FODCOF, Shoes, Coffee, Versace, Gucci, H&M, Adidas, Starbucks, B130 {POI, House Number, keyword, tag}
	- ***`refLocation`***  {string (latitude[double],longitude[double])}: Provides the location around which the search will be performed. e.g. `refLocation=28.454,77.435`
        - The `refLocation` parameter can also accept `eLoc` as reference location. This configuration is not active by default. Please contact MapmyIndia API support for further details.
        Example: `refLocation=17ZUL7`
2.  Optional Parameters:
	- *`page`*  (integer): provides number of the page to provide results from.
	- *`region`* (string): it takes in the country code. LKA, IND, BTN, BGD, NPL for Sri-Lanka, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal respectively. Default is India (IND)
	- *`radius`* (integer): provides the range of distance to search over (default: 1000, min: 500, max: 10000).
	- *`bounds`* (x1,y1;x2,y2): Allows the developer to send in map bounds to provide a nearby search of the geobounds; where x1,y1 are the lat-lng of the bound.
	- *`filter`* (): It uses key:value pair(s) to fine tune discovery of places by filtering the results. e.g. categoryCode:FODCOF
        - valid IDs for key value pairs are: 
            - `categoryCode`: can take in category codes as input
	- *`sortBy`* (string): provides configured sorting operations for the client on cloud. Below are the available sorts:
		- *`dist:asc`*  (default) & 
		- *`dist:desc`* - will sort data in order of distance from the passed 
        location.
        - *`imp`* - will sort data in order of decreasing prominence of the place.
    - *`searchBy`* (string): provides configurable search operations for the client on cloud. Below are the available sorts:
		- *`dist`*  (default) & 
		- *`imp`* - will search data in order of prominence of the place. 
    - *`pod`* (string): it takes in the place type code which helps in restricting the results to certain chosen type. Access to this parameter is controlled from the backend. This parameter if provided will override any values provided in `keywords` request param.
    Below mentioned are the codes for the pod -
	    -  *`SLC`*: Sublocality
	    - *`LC`*: Locality
	    - *`CITY`*: City
	    - *`STATE`*: State


### Operators in `keywords` parameter

To send multiple keywords in a request, we’ve defined a couple of operators that can help the developers wrap their applications around this functionality. Below are the operators:

1. The “ ; ” Operator: This operator is an “or” operator. Defining multiple keywords separated with a “ ; ” would provide results that satisfies either of the keywords.
2. The “ $ ” Operator: This operator is a “and” operator. Defining multiple keywords separated with a “ $ ” would provide results that satisfy all the provided keywords. (default).

To use these operators, simple just send in the keywords parameter like below:
```html
&keywords=coffee ; tea $ sea food ; alcohol
```

The above nearby search would yield in results that either provide coffee or tea but must provide either sea food or alcohol.

Please Note: the spacing in the above example is of no relevance to the search result. It’s just there to provide better understanding.
