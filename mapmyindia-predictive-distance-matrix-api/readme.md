## Introduction

### Route and Navigation

This API computes the distance and duration of a route between a set of source positions and a set of supplied target or destination positions.
Optionally one can specify the `date_time` parameter and get the distance and duration optimized for that part of day of a week. Time based functionality is available for selected areas only.
Supported region (countries) is India at the moment. Please note that maximum number of points are limited to 100 only including source and destination positions.

## Security Type
This APIs follow OAuth2 based security. **To know more on how to create your authorization tokens, please use our authorization token URL. More details available**  [here](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/authentication-api.php)

## Request Headers

The API leverages OAuth 2.0 based security. Hence, the developer would need to send a request for access token using their client_id and client_secret to the OAuth API. Once validated from the OAuth API, the access_token and the token_type need to be sent as Authorization header with the value: “{token_type} {access_token}”.

-  `Authorization:  “token_type access_token”`.


## Input Method
GET

## Contructing the request cURL

```c
curl --location --request GET 'https://apis.mapmyindia.com/advancedmaps/v2/distance?source=28.550614332693453,77.26893112158996&target=28.566618140144396,77.20815617692985&costing=auto&speedTypes=predictive&date_time=1,2021-12-20T11:00' \
--header 'Authorization: bearer 0XXXXXXf-dXX0-4XX0-8XXa-eXXXXXXXXXX6'
```


## Request Parameters

### Mandatory Parameters

1.  `source`: The set of source positions, separated by a semi-colon. The input is supported as a set of latitude,longitude separated by a semi-colon(;).
	- For example `28.555390931473642,77.08572454324664;28.152390931473642,77.42172454324664`.
2. `target`: The set of destination positions, separated by a semi-colon. The input is supported as a set of latitude,longitude separated by a semi-colon(;).
	- For example `28.555390931473642,77.08572454324664;28.152390931473642,77.42172454324664`.
3. `costing`:  Profile for routing engine. Currently the only applicable profile is set to automatic detection or `auto`. 
	- Example `costing=auto`.
4. `speedTypes`: To specify the type of ETA calculations. Available values are: 
	- `predictive` (default) - used to specify predictive ETA calculation. In case if this is used, then the optional parameter of `date_time` becomes mandatory.
	- `optimal`: To specify ETA calculation acc. to current time.


### Optional Parameters

1. `date_time`: This is the local date and time at the source location along with its type. The date and time is specified in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm) in the local time zone of departure. For example `2020-07-24T12:00`. Applicable types are: 
	- `0`: Current departure time.
	- `1`: Specified departure time.
- Example: `date_time=1,2021-12-20T11:00`


## Response Type
JSON: response will served as JSON


## Response Parameters

1. `sources`: array of arrays of source coordinates object.
	- `lon`: Longitude of the source in degrees.
	- `lat`: Latitude of the source in degrees.
2. `targets`: array of arrays of target coordinates object.
	- `lon`: Longitude of the target in degrees.
	- `lat`: Latitude of the target in degrees.
3. `sources_to_targets`: Returns an array of time and distance between the sources and the targets. The array is row-ordered. This means that the time and distance from the first location to all targets forms the first row of the array, followed by the time and distance from the second source location to all target locations, etc.
	- `distance` - The computed distance between each set of points in units specified by the `units` response parameter.
	- `time` - Time in seconds. The computed time between each set of points.
	- `from_index` - The origin index into the locations array.
    - `to_index` - The destination index into the locations array.
5.  `units`: Distance units for output. Allowable unit types are mi (miles) and km (kilometers). If no unit type is specified, the units defaults to kilometers.
