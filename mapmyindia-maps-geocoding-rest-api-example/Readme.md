## Introduction
All mapping APIs that are used in mobile or web apps need some geo-position coordinates to refer to any given point on the map. Our Geocoding API converts real addresses into these geographic positional information(eLoc) to be placed on a map, be it for any street, area, postal code, POI or a house number etc.

## Live Demo

## Input URL

`https://atlas.mapmyindia.com/api/places/geocode?`

## Input Method
GET

## Security Type
This APIs follow OAuth2 based security. **To know more on how to create your authorization tokens, please use our authorization token URL. More details available**  [here](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/authentication-api.php)

## Request Headers

The API leverages OAuth 2.0 based security. Hence, the developer would need to send a request for access token using their client_id and client_secret to the OAuth API. Once validated from the OAuth API, the access_token and the token_type need to be sent as Authorization header with the value: “{token_type} {access_token}”.

-  `Authorization:  “token_type access_token”`.

## Request Parameters

### Mandatory Parameters

1.  **`address`**: (string) address to be geocoded e.g. 237 Okhla industrial estate phase 3 new delhi, delhi 110020.

### Optional Parameter

2.  *`itemCount`*  (integer): parameter can be set to get maximum number of result items from the API (default: 1).
3. *`bias`*  (integer): This parameter can be used to set Urban or Rural bias. A positive value sets the Urban bias and a negative value sets Rural bias. Allowed values are:
	- `0` : Default: (No bias)
	- `-1` : Rural
	- `1` : Urban
4. *`podFilter`*  (string): This parameter can be used to set admin level restriction. The result will be either the given admin level or equivalent admin or higher in the hierarchy. No lower admin will be considered for geocoding.
Allowed values are:
	- `hno` : house number
	- `hna` : house name
	- `poi` : point of interest
	- `street` : street
	- `sslc` : sub sub locality
	- `village` : village
	- `slc` : sub locality
	- `sdist` : sub district
	- `loc` : locality
	- `city` : city
	- `dist` : district
	- `pincode` :pincode
	- `state` : state
5. *`bound`*  (string): This parameter can be used to set admin boundary, which means geocoding will be done within the given admin. The allowed admin bounds are **Sub-District**, **District**, **City**, **State** and **Pincode**. The parameter accepts the admin eLoc as value.
6. *`region`*(string): This parameter is optional for India; for other countries (such as Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan + many more) this parameter is mandatory. Possible values are listed in a table [here](https://github.com/MapmyIndia/mapmyindia-rest-api/blob/master/docs/countryISO.md).

**Note**: Please note that `podFilter` & `bound` parameters are mutually exclusive. They cannot be used together in an API call.
