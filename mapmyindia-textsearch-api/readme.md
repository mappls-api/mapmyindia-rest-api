## Introduction
Text Search API is a service that aims to provide information about a list of places on the basis of a text string entered by the user.

## Security Type
This APIs follow OAuth2 based security. **To know more on how to create your authorization tokens, please use our authorization token URL. More details available**  [here](https://www.mapmyindia.com/api/advanced-maps/doc/authentication-api.php)

## Request Headers
