        Snap-To-Road API, snaps given GPS points to the road network in the most plausible way. Maximum number of points are limited to 100 only. Our USP is to take GPS points collected along a route and return a similar set of corrected & aligned data with the points matched to the road with our intelligent Snap To Road API.<br>
        Now seamlessly calculate accurate distances from points which follow the geometry of the road & show accurate positions on map. This API provides a critical feature that is immensely valuable when tracking assets and for data analytics of path traversed by vehicle, people or assets.
        <br><br><strong>Note</strong>: <ol><li>The request might result multiple sub-traces.</li><li>Large jumps in the timestamps (> 60s) or improbable transitions lead to trace splits if a complete matching could not be found.</li><li>The algorithm might not be able to match all points. Outliers are removed if they cannot be matched successfully.</li></ol>

                    Coordinate is pair of comma separated longitude & latitude value, First coordinate will be consider as start point; a last coordinate will be as end points and between are via points; like {longitude},{latitude};{longitude},{latitude}[;{longitude},{latitude} ...]. At present maximum number of points are limited to 100 in a single request.
